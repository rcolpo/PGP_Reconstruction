# PGP_Reconstruction

![PGP Reconstruction Logo](logo_pgp.png)

Pathway-Guided Pruning Reconstruction (PGP_Reconstruction) is a Python tool for reconstructing draft constraint-based metabolic models by pruning a universal model, following the general strategy introduced by CarveMe.

## Key Features
- Better consideration of compound transport via passive diffusion
- Represents a wide range of pathways
- Returns almost zero blocked reactions
- Uses Rhea as a reaction database
- Uses Uniprot as a protein database

## Installation

PGP_Reconstruction can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install pgp_reconstruction
```

PGP_Reconstruction can automatically download and install some dependencies during the first time you run it, including: a slightly modified version of [MinPath](https://github.com/mgtools/MinPath) and some big databases, downloaded from a [external server](https://files.ufz.de/~umb-pgp_reconstruction-01/). Prodigal, downloaded from [its official GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal/releases).

However, PGP_Reconstruction can not install everything automatically, and you will need to install two external dependencies manually:
- [Diamond](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) (conda install -c bioconda diamond)
- IBM [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio/cplex-optimizer) Optimizer


## Usage

After installing PGP_RECONSTRUCTION, you can use it as: "pgprec sequenceFile". "sequenceFile" should ALWAYS be named after the name of modeled species. The sequences in the file can be DNA amino acids translated sequences. Additionally, "sequenceFile" can be an annotation file generated by Genbank (recognized extensions: '.gb', '.gbk' and '.genbank') or Prokka. After including the PGP_Reconstruction instalation folder in your path environment, the simplest possible usage case would be:

```bash
pgprec Escherichia_coli.faa
```

If you do not wish to include PGP_Reconstruction in your path environment, you can use it as:

```bash
C:\[...]\Python\Python3X\Lib\site-packages\pgp_reconstruction\cli\pgprec.py Escherichia_coli.faa
```

A more complex usage would be:

```bash
pgprec Escherichia_coli.gbk --constraints constraints.txt --reference "Escherichia coli.xml"
```
